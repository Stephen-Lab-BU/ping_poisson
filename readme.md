# ping_poisson

Project started in ~2017 with Eric Melonakos and Emily Stephen, looking for broadband spectral effects in a conductance based E-I network with PING dynamics.

Started with a PING model from DynaSim, written by Jason Sherfey. Switched from constant injected current to Homogeneous Poisson synaptic inputs.

Playing around with levels of AMPA and/or GABA external inputs to E and/or I networks, with varying input rates. Readout: entire spectral shape or 1/f slope in the knee region (Gao et al 2017).
